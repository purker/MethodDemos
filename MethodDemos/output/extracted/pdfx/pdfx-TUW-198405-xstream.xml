  <title>Multiobjective Decision Support for defining Secure Business Processes</title>
  <abstractText>Abstract: As business processes gain more importance in todays business environment, their unimpeded execution is crucial for a companyâ€™s success. Corporate decision makers are faced with a wide spectrum of potential risks on the one hand and a plenitude of security safeguards on the other hand. This paper gives an overview of a new approach for the elicitation of security requirements of business processes, for the analysis of threats and vulnerabilities and for the interactive selection of an optimal security level according to the given business processes as well as multiple objectives. It provides decision makers with an instrument for interactively defining Secure Business Processes that are economically and technically efficient.</abstractText>
