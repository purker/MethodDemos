			Within this thesis a real-world problem related to a warehouse for spare parts is&lt;br&gt; considered. Regarding several constraints typically stated by spare parts suppliers the&lt;br&gt; time needed to collect articles should be minimized. Based on continuously arriving&lt;br&gt; orders by customers prede ned delivery times and capacity constraints have to be&lt;br&gt; met. To accomplish this task e cient pickup tours need to be determined which is&lt;br&gt; the main issue covered by this work which comes to an end with experimental results&lt;br&gt; of a concrete implementation of the proposed approach.&lt;br&gt; The algorithm presented embeds a speci cally developed dynamic program for computing&lt;br&gt; optimal walks through the warehouse into a general variable neighborhood&lt;br&gt; search (VNS) scheme. Several stages are used for rst splitting up all orders, then&lt;br&gt; creating tours out of the results and nally assigning them to available workers. The&lt;br&gt; VNS uses a variant of the variable neighborhood descent (VND) as local improvement&lt;br&gt; procedure. While the neighborhood structures de ned are intended to produce&lt;br&gt; candidate solutions, a dynamic program specially designed to compute optimal order&lt;br&gt; picking tours is used to evaluate them. For this purpose properties speci c to warehouses&lt;br&gt; are exploited such to compute optimal routes within polynomial time. The&lt;br&gt;  nal assignment of workers to tours is realized by another VNS. The task is then to&lt;br&gt;  nd an allocation such that the last article to be picked up will be collected as early&lt;br&gt; as possible.&lt;br&gt; Evaluations of experimental results of a concrete implementation indicate that the&lt;br&gt; presented approach provides valuable pickup plans and computation times can be&lt;br&gt; kept low. Moreover the performed test runs have been compared to a reference solution&lt;br&gt; which was computed based on an approach found in relevant literature. A&lt;br&gt; detailed analysis of the obtained results showed that the application of the proposed&lt;br&gt; approach to real-world instances is promising whereas the savings with respect to&lt;br&gt; working time can be kept high. Overall an e cient as well as e ective approach is&lt;br&gt; introduced to solve this real-world problem.
