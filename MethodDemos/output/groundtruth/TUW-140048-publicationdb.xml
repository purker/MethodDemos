  <title>An Implementation to transform Business Collaboration Models to executable Process Specifications</title>
  <abstractText>
			UN/CEFACT?s Modeling Methodology (UMM) is a well accepted and formal&lt;br&gt; notation to analyze and design B2B business processes. In a service oriented architecture&lt;br&gt; (SOA) environment process specification languages like the Business Process&lt;br&gt; Specification Schema (BPSS) are used to configure B2B information systems. However,&lt;br&gt; mappings from UMM models to BPSS process specifications currently exist just&lt;br&gt; on a conceptual level. This results in a gap between defined B2B processes and BPSS&lt;br&gt; configurable e-commerce systems. Thus, a model driven code generation of BPSS&lt;br&gt; descriptions is required. In this paper we present a technical implementation of a&lt;br&gt; transformation engine that generates BPSS process specifications from a UMM model&lt;br&gt; represented in the XML Metadata Interchange (XMI) language. This implementation&lt;br&gt; bridges the gap mentioned above. It has been used in the EU project GILDAnet to&lt;br&gt; generate BPSS descriptions from logistic processes modeled in UMM.
