  <title>A model of employee selection for SME based on innovation transfer</title>
  <abstractText>
			Human resource strategy can emerge within a decentralized decision&lt;br&gt; structure that gives managers autonomy to take responsive actions while overall strategic direction is considered within a strategic planning process. This study defines the concept of employee selection (especially strategic employee selection) and hypothesizes on the positive correlation between innovation characteristic in SME and value of strategic employee (the so called personnel usefulness function). An empirical study illustrates the importance of both&lt;br&gt; elements in an integrative human resource strategy formation process&lt;br&gt; particularly for firms operating in the international environments.
