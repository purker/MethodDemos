  <title>Model-driven Development Meets Security: An Evaluation of Current Approaches</title>
  <abstractText>
			Although our society is critically dependent on&lt;br&gt; software systems, these systems are mainly secured by&lt;br&gt; protection mechanisms during operation instead of&lt;br&gt; considering security issues during software design.&lt;br&gt; Deficiencies in software design are the main reasons for&lt;br&gt; security incidents, resulting in severe economic&lt;br&gt; consequences for (i) the organizations using the software&lt;br&gt; and (ii) the development companies. Lately, model-driven&lt;br&gt; development has been proposed in order to increase the&lt;br&gt; quality and thereby the security of software systems. This&lt;br&gt; paper evaluates current efforts that position security as a&lt;br&gt; fundamental element in model-driven development,&lt;br&gt; highlights their deficiencies and identifies current&lt;br&gt; research challenges. The evaluation shows that applying&lt;br&gt; special-purpose methods to particular aspects of the&lt;br&gt; problem is more suitable than applying generic ones,&lt;br&gt; since (i) the problem can be represented on the proper&lt;br&gt; abstraction level, (ii) the user can build on the knowledge&lt;br&gt; of experts, and (iii) the available tools are more efficient&lt;br&gt; and powerful.
