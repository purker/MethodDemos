  <title>Position Paper: m2n-A Tool for Translating Models to Natural Language Descriptions</title>
  <abstractEnglish>
			To describe the structure of a system, the UML Class Diagram yields&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; the means-of-choice. Therefor, the Class Diagram provides concepts like class, attribute, operation, association, generalization, aggregation, enumeration, etc. When&lt;br&gt;  students are introduced to this diagram, they often have to solve exercises where&lt;br&gt;  texts in natural language are given and they have to model the described systems.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; When analyzing such exercises, it becomes evident that certain kinds of phrases describing a particular concept appear again and again contextualized to the described&lt;br&gt;  domain.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; In this paper, we present an approach which allows the automatic generation of textual speci&amp;#64257;cations from a given Class Diagram based on standard phrases in natural&lt;br&gt;  language. Besides supporting teachers in preparing exercises, such an approach is&lt;br&gt;  also valuable for various e-learning scenarios.
