  <title>Teachers&apos; and Tutor&apos;s Social Reflection around SenseCam Images</title>
  <abstractEnglish>
			As photographic technologies continue to develop, so too do the social practices surrounding their use. The focus of this paper is on &lt;br&gt; the social practices surrounding images captured from a new photographic device-SenseCam-which, rather than capturing individual &lt;br&gt; images when triggered by the user, automatically captures a series of images. This paper is concerned with the use of SenseCam digital &lt;br&gt; images in social contexts where there is a professional purpose-supporting the collaborative re&amp;#64258;ective practices of school teachers and &lt;br&gt; university tutors as part of their professional development. Analysis of video data collected from 16 in-situ case studies of re&amp;#64258;ective &lt;br&gt; discussions shows evidence that re&amp;#64258;ection took place as de&amp;#64257;ned in the literature. Further the phototalk around SenseCam images was &lt;br&gt; found to bene&amp;#64257;t re&amp;#64258;ection in these social situations through promotion of a rich shared understanding of the lesson context: supporting &lt;br&gt; return to the experience, sharing of background context, grounding conversations, illustrating and providing evidence, and allowing &lt;br&gt; people to see more. The paper concludes with a discussion on how different features of SenseCam images, such as variable quality, lack &lt;br&gt; of audio and incompleteness, helped in this re&amp;#64258;ection or not. Finally implications from this work and participant?s comments are used to &lt;br&gt; suggest ways in which SenseCam may be used in the future in teachers? and tutors? social re&amp;#64258;ection.
