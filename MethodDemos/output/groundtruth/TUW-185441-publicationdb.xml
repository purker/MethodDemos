  <title>Measuring Shape Analysis Precision</title>
  <abstractText>
			Shape analysis is a static program analysis technique for discovering properties of heap-allocated data structures. It is crucial to finding software bugs or to verify high-level correctness properties. Various analyses have been introduced but their relation in terms of precision often remains unclear as different analyses use different abstractions of the heap.&lt;br&gt; The aim of our work is to compare the precision of shape analyses. We propose a novel algorithm based on three-valued logic that extracts alias sets from shape graphs. Smaller sets are more precise and indicate a more precise underlying shape analysis. Using this metric, we experimentally compare - for the first time - the relative quality of the state-of-the-art graph-based shape analyses and make recommendations concerning the combination of analysis parameters.
