  <title>A Comparison of User Description Languages Concerning Adaptability Based on User Preferences</title>
  <abstractText>
			The user interface is the most important feature of interaction between&lt;br&gt; users and (AAL) services. Explicitly defined user interfaces are bound to a specific&lt;br&gt; toolkit and programming language or markup language. Thus a separate user in-&lt;br&gt; terface definition has to be created manually for different classes of I/O devices to&lt;br&gt; be supported. Compared to manual user interface creation, the automatic or semi-&lt;br&gt; automatic generation of user interfaces based on interaction descriptions consid-&lt;br&gt; erably reduces the manual effort necessary for integrating a large number of de-&lt;br&gt; vices and therefore automatically increases the number of supported devices. The&lt;br&gt; main goal of this paper is to provide an overview of selected existing solutions&lt;br&gt; for the definition of generic user interactions and the generation of user interfaces.&lt;br&gt; The comparison shows that the aspect of adaptability is partly covered by the pre-&lt;br&gt; sented User Interaction Description Languages. Nevertheless it is important to an-&lt;br&gt; alyze them with respect to additional criteria, like accessibility, context- and use-&lt;br&gt; case awareness, to receive a meaningful overview of advantages and drawbacks of&lt;br&gt; the different approaches leading to a good basis for choosing one of the presented&lt;br&gt; approaches.
