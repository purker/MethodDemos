  <title>Inscribing Futures through Responsible Design by Responsible Designers</title>
  <abstractEnglish>
			As technology designers, we often inadvertently inscribe values and concepts in systems beyond what we intended. Further, while we aim to work from a user- and use-centred perspective, we often miss the perspectives of other critical stakeholders and the broader context in which technology systems are to be used. Reflecting on issues of responsible innovation from the bottom up, this paper explores two exemplar cases: designing for older people and health care agendas, and designing for eco-behaviour change agendas. While very different in focus, both highlight the importance that different conceptualisations have on shaping possible solutions, and the challenge of identifying and negotiating competing agendas. This draws attention to the limits of both top-down and bottom-up perspectives and suggests instead a middle out approach to responsible design that considers both policy and practice aspects in the process. It also calls for us as responsible designers to be reflective practitioners aware of our power in inscribing possible future
