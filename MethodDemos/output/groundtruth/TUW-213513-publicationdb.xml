  <title>Test Case Generation by Grammar-based Fuzzing for Model-driven Engineering</title>
  <abstractText>
			Thorough testing of tools that support the evolution of software models is essential in order to avoid the introduction of inconsistent models. However, real-life test cases with sufficient coverage are difficult to obtain. We suggest a method to generate random software models to facilitate fuzz testing of applications dealing with model evolution. We implemented and tested our approach to find bugs in a tool that solves a problem of model merging. Using the randomly created models as input, we were able to (1) detect errors in the algorithm, which could not be revealed by using hand-crafted models and (2) identify a significant performance bottleneck.
