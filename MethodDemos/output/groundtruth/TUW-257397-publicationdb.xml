  <title>Unanticipated Context Awareness for Software Configuration Access Using the getenv API</title>
  <abstractEnglish>
			Configuration files, command-line arguments and environment variables&lt;br&gt; are the dominant tools for local configuration management today. When accessing&lt;br&gt; such program execution environments, however, most applications do not take con-&lt;br&gt; text, e.g. the system they run on, into account. The aim of this paper is to integrate&lt;br&gt; unmodified applications into a coherent and context-aware system by instrumenting&lt;br&gt; the getenv API. We propose a global database stored in configuration files that in-&lt;br&gt; cludes specifications for contextual interpretations and a novel matching algorithm.&lt;br&gt; In a case study we analyze a complete Debian operating system where every getenv&lt;br&gt; API call is intercepted. We evaluate usage patterns of 16 real-world applications and&lt;br&gt; systems and report on limitations of unforeseen context changes. The results show&lt;br&gt; that getenv is used extensively for variability. The tool has acceptable overhead and&lt;br&gt; improves context-awareness of many applications.
