  <title>Using a Solution Archive to Enhance Metaheuristics for the Rooted Delay-Constrained Minimum Spanning Tree Problem</title>
  <abstractText>
			When designing a communication network with a central server broadcasting&lt;br&gt; information to all the participants of the network, some applications, such as&lt;br&gt; video conferences, require a limitation of the maximal delay from the server to&lt;br&gt; each client. Beside this delay-constraint minimizing the cost of establishing the&lt;br&gt; network is in most cases an important design criterion. This network design&lt;br&gt; problem can be modeled as an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem&lt;br&gt; called rooted delay-constrained minimum spanning tree (RDCMST) problem. The&lt;br&gt; objective is to find a minimum cost spanning tree of a given graph with the&lt;br&gt; additional constraint that the sum of delays along the paths from a specified&lt;br&gt; root node to any other node must not exceed a given delay-bound.&lt;br&gt; More formally, we are given an undirected graph G = (V;E) with a set V&lt;br&gt; of n nodes, a set E of m edges, a cost function c : E ! R+&lt;br&gt; 0 , a delay function&lt;br&gt; d : E ! R+, a fixed root node s 2 V , and a delay-bound B &gt; 0. An optimal&lt;br&gt; solution to the RDCMST problem is a spanning tree T = (V;E0); E0 E, with&lt;br&gt; minimum cost c(T) =&lt;br&gt; &amp;#931;&lt;br&gt; e2E0 c(e), satisfying the constraints&lt;br&gt; &amp;#931;&lt;br&gt; e2P(s;v) d(e) &lt;br&gt; B; 8v 2 V , where P(s; v) denotes the unique path from root s to node v.&lt;br&gt; Exact approaches to the RDCMST problem have been examined by Gouveia&lt;br&gt; et al. in [1] based on the concept of constrained shortest paths utilized in column&lt;br&gt; generation, Lagrangian relaxation methods and a flow-based reformulation of the&lt;br&gt; problem on layered acyclic graphs. All these methods can only solve small instances&lt;br&gt; with significantly less than 100 nodes to proven optimality in reasonable&lt;br&gt; time when considering complete graphs. A constructive heuristic approach based&lt;br&gt; on Prim?s algorithm to find a minimum spanning tree is described by Salama&lt;br&gt; et al. in [6]. In [4] we present a more de-centralized approach by applying the&lt;br&gt; basic concept of Kruskal?s minimum spanning tree algorithm to the RDCMST&lt;br&gt; problem. Two metaheuristics based on GRASP and variable neighborhood descent&lt;br&gt; (VND) improve the constructed solution. In [5] we reuse this VND as the&lt;br&gt; local search component in a general variable neighborhood search (GVNS) and&lt;br&gt; a MAX &amp;#1048576; MIN ant system (MMAS). The MMAS mostly obtains the best&lt;br&gt; results in the performed tests.
