  <title>Polynomial Combined Rewritings for Linear Existential Rules and DL-Lite with n-ary Relations</title>
  <abstractText>
			This paper considers the setting of ontology-based query answering (OBQA). In this&lt;br&gt; setting, Description Logics (DLs) and existential rules (a.k.a. tuple-generating dependencies&lt;br&gt; or Datalog? rules) are popular ontology languages, while conjunctive queries&lt;br&gt; (CQs) is the main querying tool. Among KR researchers there is a clear consensus that&lt;br&gt; the required level of scalability in OBQA can only be achieved via query rewriting,&lt;br&gt; which attempts to reduce OBQA into the problem of evaluating a query over a relational&lt;br&gt; database. Two query languages are usually considered: first-order queries (FO)&lt;br&gt; and non-recursive Datalog queries (NDL).&lt;br&gt; An interesting approach to query rewriting is the polynomial combined approach [7],&lt;br&gt; which can be described as follows: an ontology &amp;#931; can be incorporated together with a&lt;br&gt; CQ q into a database query q&amp;#931; in polynomial time, and also with a database D into&lt;br&gt; a database D&amp;#931; in polynomial time, such that q&amp;#931; over D&amp;#931; yields the same result as q&lt;br&gt; evaluated over the knowledge base consisting of D and &amp;#931;. The polynomial combined&lt;br&gt; approach has been applied to ELHdr&lt;br&gt; &amp;#8869; [7], an extension of the well-known DL EL, to&lt;br&gt; DL-LiteN&lt;br&gt; horn [5, 6], one of the most expressive logics of the DL-Lite family, and only&lt;br&gt; recently to the main guarded- and sticky-based classes of existential rules [3].
