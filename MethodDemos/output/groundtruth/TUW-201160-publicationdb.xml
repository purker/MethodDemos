  <title>Variable neighborhood search for capacitated connected facility location</title>
  <abstractText>
			The Capacitated Connected Facility Location Problem (CConFL) is an NP-&lt;br&gt; hard combinatorial optimization problem which arises in the design of last mile&lt;br&gt; communication networks (fiber-to-the-curb scenarios) [1]. Formally, we are given&lt;br&gt; an undirected, weighted graph G = (V,E), with edge costs ce 0, 8e 2 E. The&lt;br&gt; node set V = {r}[F [T is the disjoint union of the root node r, potential facility&lt;br&gt; locations F, and possible Steiner nodes T . Each facility i 2 F has associated&lt;br&gt; opening costs fi 0 and a maximum assignable capacity Di 2 N. Furthermore,&lt;br&gt; we are given a set of potential customers C, with individual capacity demands&lt;br&gt; dk 2 N and prizes pk 0, 8k 2 C, the latter corresponding to the expected&lt;br&gt; profit when supplying customer k. Each customer k 2 C may be assigned to one&lt;br&gt; facility of a subset Fk F, with assignment costs ai,k 0, 8i 2 Fk. A solution to&lt;br&gt; CConFL S = (RS, TS, FS,CS, S) consists of a Steiner Tree (RS, TS), RS V ,&lt;br&gt; TS E, connecting the set of opened facilities FS F and the root node r.&lt;br&gt; CS C is the set of customers feasibly (i.e. respecting the capacity constraints)&lt;br&gt; assigned to facilities FS, whereas the actual mapping between customers and&lt;br&gt; facilities is described by S : CS ! FS. The objective value of a feasible solution&lt;br&gt; S is given by c(S) = Pe2TS&lt;br&gt; ce+Pi2FS&lt;br&gt; fi+Pk2CS&lt;br&gt; a S(k),k+Pk2C\CS&lt;br&gt; pk, and we&lt;br&gt; aim to identify a most profitable solution minimizing this function. This variant&lt;br&gt; of CConFL has already been tackled by exact methods based on mixed integer&lt;br&gt; programming [2] and hybrid approaches based on Lagrangian relaxation [1].&lt;br&gt; Here, we present the first pure metaheuristic approach, which computes high&lt;br&gt; quality solution faster than existing approaches.
